# Diabetes_Prediction

Diabetes Prediction Model and Streamlit Deployment
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their medical attributes. The model is trained on the Indians Diabetes Database and deployed using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly web interface.

Requirements
Python Packages
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.
pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
streamlit: For creating and deploying the web application.
